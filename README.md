# CDS plugin for SAP Cloud Application Event Hub

## About this project

The `com.sap.cds:cds-feature-event-hub` dependency is
a [CAP Java plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/building-plugins) that provides out-of-the box integration with SAP Cloud Application Event Hub.

## Requirements and Setup

See [Getting Started](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell?impl-variant=java) on how to jumpstart your development and grow as you go with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.

### SAP Cloud Application Event Hub

For details on how to use SAP Cloud Application Event Hub, please see the [SAP Cloud Application Event Hub Service Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-cloud-application-event-hub/sap-cloud-application-event-hub-service-guide/what-is).

### CDS Plugin

The usage of CAP Java plugins is described in the [CAP Java Documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/building-plugins#reference-the-new-cds-model-in-an-existing-cap-java-project). Following this documentation this plugin needs to be referenced in the `srv/pom.xml` of a CAP Java project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
    <artifactId>cds-feature-event-hub</artifactId>
    <version>${latest-version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The latest version can be found in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) or in the [Maven Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.sap.cds/cds-feature-event-hub/versions).

### Overriding the CloudEvent source suffix

In multitenant scenarios the CloudEvent `source` is composed of the configured `ceSource` and, by default, the current tenant ID. If the tenant ID differs from the subaccount ID registered as the UCL system ID, an application can override the suffix per message by setting the `eventhub.btp.subaccountId` header when emitting the event:

```java
Map<String, Object> headers = new HashMap<>();
headers.put("eventhub.btp.subaccountId", subaccountId);
// emit the event with these headers
```

The header is consumed by the plugin and is not included in the outgoing message. If it is absent or blank, the tenant ID is used as before.
